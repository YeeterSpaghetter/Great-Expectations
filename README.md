My dream job is to be a Data Analyst, or some sort of Video Game Software Engineer. It is my dream to do this because I have always liked video games and appreciated especially the deeper aspects. For awhile I thought about just straight software engineering, but I feel like that would get boring, and working on even model, or anything to do with aspects of a larger game with a team sounds like a amazing job to do. Being a data analayst also always just comes naturally to me, as I love looking at any data based around anything, like statistics over everyday objects.
